# LangSmith BYOC - GCP Customer Service Account (Beta)

> **Beta:** GCP BYOC is in beta. This module's inputs, outputs, and granted roles may change between releases. Pin a release tag, and check the release notes before upgrading.

Provisions the service account in **your GCP project** that the LangSmith control plane impersonates to stand up and manage BYOC data planes in your project.

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `var.service_account_id` (default `langsmith-byoc-provisioner`) | The identity the control plane provisions data planes as. |
| Custom roles `<prefix>Provisioner`, `<prefix>ProjectIamGranter`, `<prefix>ServiceAccountUser` | Exactly the permissions data plane provisioning and teardown use, bound to the service account. See [Permissions](#permissions). With `byo_iam`, only `<prefix>Provisioner`, with fewer permissions. |
| Data plane service accounts, their project roles, and the custom role `<prefix>ServiceAccountIamManager` | Only with `byo_iam`. See [Bring your own IAM](#bring-your-own-iam). |
| Token Creator on that service account | Lets `var.crossplane_service_account`, the LangSmith control plane, impersonate it. No other LangSmith identity is trusted. |
| Project APIs | Enables the APIs data planes use. Set `enable_apis = false` if you manage the project's APIs elsewhere. |

## Prerequisites

1. A GCP project for the LangSmith data plane, and credentials with permission to create service accounts, grant project IAM roles, and enable APIs in it.
2. Terraform `>= 1.11.0` and the Google provider `~> 6.0`.
3. The `crossplane_service_account` provided by LangChain.
4. The external ID from **Settings > Data Planes** in the LangSmith UI. Copy this value and use it as `external_id`. Do not make your own value.

## Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "external_id" {
  description = "External ID from Settings > Data Planes in the LangSmith UI."
  type        = string
}

module "langsmith_byoc_service_account" {
  source = "github.com/langchain-ai/terraform//modules/byoc/gcp/langsmith-byoc-service-account?ref=<release tag>"

  project_id                 = "<your-project-id>"
  crossplane_service_account = "<provided by LangChain>"
  external_id                = var.external_id
}

output "provisioner_service_account" {
  value = module.langsmith_byoc_service_account.provisioner_service_account
}
```

Set `external_id` in the `terraform.tfvars` file of your root module to the value from **Settings > Data Planes**:

```hcl
external_id = "<external-id-copied-from-langsmith>"
```

Share the `provisioner_service_account` output with LangChain when you create a data plane.

### External ID

Every customer's provisioner trusts the same LangSmith Crossplane service account. So before LangSmith uses a provisioner, it checks that the description of the service account is the external ID of the LangSmith organization that creates the data plane. The module writes `external_id` as that description. This stops another LangSmith organization from using your provisioner.

## Permissions

By default, the provisioner holds three custom roles, not predefined admin roles:

- **`<prefix>Provisioner`**: the permissions for creating, updating and deleting data plane resources. These are the VPC, subnets, Cloud NAT, the Private Service Connect endpoint, GKE, Cloud SQL, Memorystore, Cloud Storage, Cloud DNS, Secret Manager and the data plane service accounts. It also has the list and get permissions that teardown needs to confirm deletions. The list comes from provisioning and tearing down data planes with nothing more.
- **`<prefix>ProjectIamGranter`**: reads and sets the project IAM policy. The binding has an IAM condition so the provisioner can only add or remove grants of the project roles the data planes use: `artifactregistry.reader`, `cloudsql.admin`, `cloudsql.client`, `container.admin`, `container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`, `dns.admin`, `redis.dbConnectionUser` and `secretmanager.secretAccessor`.
- **`<prefix>ServiceAccountUser`**: `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`, so GKE nodes and workloads can run as the data plane service accounts. IAM conditions are not evaluated for actAs, so this binding is unconditional.

With `byo_iam`, the permissions change. See [Bring your own IAM](#bring-your-own-iam).

### Use a project that holds only LangSmith resources

The project is the boundary of the provisioner's access, as the data plane resource group is on Azure. GCP IAM conditions cannot limit service account permissions by account name; they see only the account's numeric ID. So by default, the provisioner's service account permissions (`iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy`, `actAs`) apply to every service account in the project. Through them, the provisioner could act as any of those accounts. Keep other workloads and service accounts out of the project. [`byo_iam`](#bring-your-own-iam) takes the other service accounts out of the provisioner's reach, but its other permissions still apply to the whole project.

Custom role IDs are unique per project, so set `custom_role_id_prefix` when more than one copy of the module targets a project.

### Bring your own IAM

Set `byo_iam = true` to create the data plane service accounts and their project roles yourself. The provisioner then needs no service account admin and no project IAM writes.

> **CAUTION:** Set `byo_iam` before you create data planes in the project. Do not change it while data planes exist.

The module then creates these service accounts in the project. LangSmith finds them by these account IDs. All data planes in the project share them.

| Service account | Used by | Project roles |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| `langsmith-workload` | The LangSmith application | `roles/cloudsql.client`, `roles/redis.dbConnectionUser` |
| `langsmith-external-secrets` | External Secrets Operator | `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` |
| `langsmith-cert-manager` | cert-manager | `roles/dns.admin` |
| `langsmith-postgres-setup` | The job that sets up the Cloud SQL databases | `roles/cloudsql.admin` |
| `langsmith-node` | GKE nodes | `roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`, `roles/artifactregistry.reader` |
| `langsmith-sandbox-host` | Sandbox GKE nodes | `roles/container.defaultNodeServiceAccount`, `roles/artifactregistry.reader`, `roles/redis.dbConnectionUser` |

It also grants `roles/container.admin` on the project to `var.crossplane_service_account`. The LangSmith control plane reaches the data plane GKE clusters through it.

In this mode, the provisioner gets:

- **`<prefix>Provisioner`** without `iam.serviceAccounts.create`, `delete`, `update` and `setIamPolicy`. It keeps `get`, `list` and `getIamPolicy`.
- **`<prefix>ServiceAccountIamManager`**: `iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy` and `iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy`, bound on each of the six service accounts, not on the project.
- **`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`**, bound on `langsmith-node` and `langsmith-sandbox-host` only. GKE node pools run as them.

The module does not create `<prefix>ProjectIamGranter` or `<prefix>ServiceAccountUser`. So the provisioner cannot create, update or delete service accounts and cannot change the project IAM policy. It can set IAM policies on these six accounts only, and act as `langsmith-node` and `langsmith-sandbox-host` only. It can still read the other service accounts in the project and their IAM policies.

LangSmith still creates the Workload Identity bindings on these accounts, and the Token Creator grant of `langsmith-workload` on itself. The Workload Identity bindings need the project's workload identity pool, which exists only after LangSmith creates the first GKE cluster. That is why the provisioner can set the IAM policies of the six accounts. Through them, it can let an identity act as any of the six.

Create the data plane with `byoiam_enabled` set to `true`.
